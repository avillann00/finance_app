# Finance app

## Overview

This app is made using flask in python. The website tracks finances and gives a summary as well as tracks other things such as stock prices and exchange rates

### Finances

After making an account and filling out some preliminary data you will get a summary based on the things that you input

It will also make a budget for you and give pointers on how to save

This takes advantage of using SQLAlchemy and some of flask's account management

### Stocks

Using aplphavantage.co and their api, the latest closing prices for some stocks are extracted

### Exchange rates

Using openexchangerates.org and their api, the current exchange rates for some of the worlds currencies are extracted
